  "summary": "The implementation successfully fulfills all core requirements. The backend implements the Student type with stable storage, add/get/update methods. The frontend provides a form for adding students, displays all records with edit functionality, has no authentication, and uses a warm educational color scheme with terracotta and sage green. However, the backend implements additional sorting features not requested in the BuildRequest.",
