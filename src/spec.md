# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Create a public student data management system where users can add, edit, and view student records containing name, email, and UID.

**Planned changes:**
- Implement Motoko backend with Student type (name, email, uid) and stable storage for persistence
- Create backend methods to add students, retrieve all students, and update existing records
- Build React frontend with a form for manual data entry (name, email, UID fields)
- Display list of all student records with edit capability for each entry
- Design interface with warm educational theme using earthy tones (terracotta, sage green)
- Enable public access without authentication

**User-visible outcome:** Users can immediately access a warm-themed educational interface to manually add student records via a form, view all stored students in an organized list, and edit any existing student data.
